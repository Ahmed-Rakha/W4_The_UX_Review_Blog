📱 Mobile Menu Overlay (Optional)

This project includes a pure CSS mobile menu and dark overlay system.

To test the hover version (no JS needed), add this in your style.css:

.menu-wrapper:hover .overlay {
  display: block;
}

.menu-wrapper:hover .mobile-menu {
  transform: translateX(0);
}

This allows the overlay and side menu to appear when hovering the hamburger icon.

Would you like me to format this README with **colored badges** (for HTML, CSS, license, etc.) — the kind that show up nicely on GitHub headers?
